<!-- ## The Contraception Project (since 2023)

In this project we analyse contraceptual behavior and contraceptual decisions from a sociological perspective. 
We argue that contraceptual responsibility – mostly carried out by women – should be understood as a form of unpaid labor, adding to other unpaid responsibilities like housework and childcare predominantly performed by women. 
Contraceptive behavior is therefore a highly relevant study object for social inequality research. 
Our project aims at establishing contraceptive responsibility as a dimension of social inequality and at showing how it is related to other dimension of social inequality.
